Introduction:

The provided code is an implementation of a simple web application that allows users to sign up, login, and logout. The web application uses Go as the programming language, MySQL as the database management system, and the Gorilla toolkit for session management.

Code Explanation:

The code starts by importing the required packages and libraries, including the database/sql, fmt, html/template, net/http, bcrypt, and gorilla/sessions.

Next, a new session store is created using the Gorilla toolkit. The MySQL database is also initialized and tested for connectivity using the db.Ping() function.

Afterward, several functions are defined to handle various requests, including CreateAccount(), loginPage(), Logout(), and index().

The CreateAccount() function handles the user sign-up process by receiving a POST request from the user and saving their username, email, and password to the MySQL database after hashing the password using the bcrypt algorithm.

The loginPage() function handles user login requests by checking the user's input username and password against the values stored in the database using the bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword() function. If the credentials are valid, the user is redirected to the application's home page.

The Logout() function handles user logout requests by destroying the user's session and redirecting them to the login page.

Finally, the index() function is responsible for displaying the home page to the user.

The handleRequest() function defines the routes and their corresponding functions and starts the server on localhost:8080.

Conclusion:

The provided code implements a simple web application that allows users to sign up, login, and logout. The application uses Go as the programming language, MySQL as the database management system, and the Gorilla toolkit for session management.
